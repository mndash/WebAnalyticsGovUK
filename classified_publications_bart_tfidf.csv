The changes detailed below had been incorporated into the catch certificate application. Exporters of fishery products will now need to familiarise themselves with the updated requirements to ensure continued compliance and avoid delays or rejections at border control points. These changes became mandatory in January 2026 and remain in effect. New requirement: If you export products that have been caught by a UK vessel and processed in the UK after landing from January 2026, these consignments will require both a catch certificate AND a processing statement. Please see the guidance below for more information. During this initial period, the new fields were optional to complete. This phased approach was designed to give exporters time to become familiar with the information they would need to provide once the requirements became mandatory in January 2026. The new requirements are as follows: UK catch certificate and UK processing statements As of January 2026, if fish is landed in the UK and processed after landing, the consignment must be accompanied by a catch certificate for the landed weight being exported AND a processing statement referencing that catch certificate. This guidance has been published to help users comply with the change. You should familiarise yourself with this requirement to ensure ongoing compliance. The weight on the UK Catch Certificate must reflect the weight, state, and presentation of the fish being exported that was landed by the vessel.

Documents Seagrass and seahorse diving guidance note PDF , 264 KB , 3 pages Details Seagrass – Our hidden marine habitat Seagrass is an underwater flowering plant. It is the only marine flowering plant able to survive and pollinate fully submerged. Once found widespread across the UK, our seagrass beds have declined by over 40% since the 1930s. This is mainly due to coastal development, pollution and wasting disease, as well as physical disturbance. Seagrass form beds, or meadows, in shallow coastal areas (intertidal and subtidal regions) where they receive plenty of light. They also prefer sheltered bays and lagoons protected from significant wave action. There are two recognised species of seagrass in the UK: Common eelgrass (Zostera marina) Found in deeper water (intertidal to sublittoral region), in fully submerged conditions to about 10 meters deep typically on sand, mud or course gravel. It is the largest British seagrass and forms dense beds, with trailing leaves up to 2 meters long. Dwarf eelgrass (Zostera noltii) Found closer to the shore (intertidal to shallow subtidal region) on fine sand and mud. It forms dense beds, with leaves up to 20cm long. Both species grow horizontal stems (rhizomes) which spread under the substrate, rooting it firmly to the seabed. It also has air pockets (lacunae) in the veins of its leaves to help the seagrass blades float in an upright position in the water. It is an important part of our marine ecosystem, serving as a nursey and home for a wide variety of marine species.

This includes ensuring fishing and mNLA management measures are put in place for England’s highly protected marine areas (HPMAs). MPAs are areas of the ocean established to protect habitats, species and processes essential for healthy, functioning marine ecosystems. The purpose of an MPA is to protect and recover rare threatened and important marine ecosystems, habitats and species from damage caused by human activities. In England, MPAs are designated to protect marine ecosystems or specific habitats or species (also known as ‘features’) and have conservation objectives which state what conservation outcomes the MPA is designed to achieve. Highly protected marine areas (HPMAs) are a type of MPA. HPMAs are designated to receive the highest levels of protection and allow for the recovery of all species, habitats and associated ecosystem processes within the site boundary. There are 178 MPAs in English waters, covering 51% of inshore and 37% of offshore waters.

If you wish to submit a representation or objection in relation to a Harbour Order which is currently in the 42 day public consultation period, please see our guidance Harbour Orders overview A harbour is defined by the Harbours Act 1964 ( HA 1964) as any natural or artificial harbour, any port, haven, estuary, tidal or other river or inland waterway navigated by sea-going ships. It also includes docks and wharves. Statutory Harbour Authorities (SHAs) are Statutory Bodies responsible for the management and running of a harbour. The powers and duties in relation to a harbour are set out in local Acts of Parliament or a Harbour Order under the HA 1964. Harbour Orders are a form of delegated legislation which either amends existing legislation or introduces new harbour legislation. They are made as a statutory instrument under the HA 1964 and confers powers on the SHA for the purpose of improving, maintaining or managing a harbour. All applications for Harbour Orders were processed by the Department for Transport ( DfT ) until 2010 when the MMO was established under the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009 ( MCAA ). Section 42A of MCAA made provision for certain functions to be delegated by the relevant authority to the MMO. The Harbours Act 1964 (Delegation of Functions) Order 2010 enabled the MMO to carry out the functions of the DfT Secretary of State in relation to Harbour Orders (including harbours designated as fishery harbours under the Sea Fish Industry Act 1951).

Dredging,https://www.gov.uk/guidance/dredging,30 May 2019,"Dredging This guidance explains when dredging activities may need a marine licence from the Marine Management Organisation. Applies to England and Northern Ireland Overview You may need a marine licence to carry out a dredging in English Waters or Northern Ireland offshore waters. Dredging means using equipment to move material in the sea or on the seabed. It includes removing sediment completely or moving it from one place to another. Some types of dredging are exempt from needing a licence. You can check if your activity is exempt before you apply . Types of dredging There are different types of dredging, depending on the purpose of the activity. Clearance dredging This is done to remove material that has built up around a structure or asset, for reasons other than navigation. It usually needs a marine licence, but some activities may be eligible for self-service licensing . Aggregate dredging This is the removal of sand and gravel from the seabed for use in construction. Aggregate dredging always requires a marine licence. Categories of dredging All dredging activities are classed as either capital or maintenance, depending on the depth and history of the area. Capital dredging This is dredging to a depth that either: has not been dredged before has not been dredged in the last 10 years It’s usually done to: create or deepen a navigational channel or berth remove unsuitable material before construction Maintenance dredging Maintenance dredging involves removing recently built-up material, such as mud, sand or gravel, to keep areas like berths and channels at their intended depth. This includes dredging for navigation, to make sure vessels can pass safely. To count as maintenance dredging, the activity must meet both of these conditions: the dredging does not go deeper than the seabed level at any point in the last 10 years there is evidence that dredging has been carried out to that depth or deeper in the last 10 years Whether maintenance dredging needs a licence","Dredging Dredging This guidance explains when dredging activities may need a marine licence from the Marine Management Organisation Dredging means using equipment to move material in the sea or on the seabed Some types of dredging are exempt from needing a licence Aggregate dredging always requires a marine licence Categories of dredging All dredging activities are classed as either capital or maintenance, depending on the depth and history of the area Capital dredging This is dredging to a depth that either: has not been dredged before has not been dredged in the last 10 years It’s usually done to: create or deepen a navigational channel or berth remove unsuitable material before construction Maintenance dredging Maintenance dredging involves removing recently built-up material, such as mud, sand or gravel, to keep areas like berths and channels at their intended depth This includes dredging for navigation, to make sure vessels can pass safely To count as maintenance dredging, the activity must meet both of these conditions: the dredging does not go deeper than the seabed level at any point in the last 10 years there is evidence that dredging has been carried out to that depth or deeper in the last 10 years Whether maintenance dredging needs a licence",Marine Licensing,0.3824246,0.32313824,Marine Licensing,OK

An MMO case manager will notify you of the suitable fee band for your application. This can be changed if new information about your project makes a different band more suitable. If your application is moved to a different band, MMO will seek your agreement before doing any further work. Where an application is to carry out more than 1 licensable activity and they fall in different fee bands, the higher fee band is payable. For example, an application to dredge material and dispose of it at sea includes a band 3 project (dredging) and a band 2 project (disposal – if fewer than 1 million cubic metres), so the fees applied to the application will be band 3. From 1 April 2019, the MMO will recover the costs for carrying out marine licence monitoring inspections for all existing licences that expire after 1st April 2020 and all new applications received after 1st April 2019.

Please note that this illustration does not apply to Self-service applications. When you apply Image of welcome page for Marine Case Management System Applications for marine licences are submitted via the Marine Case Management System ( MCMS ). We first check your application to confirm that the activity is licensable. We then assess the scope of the application to generate a cost estimate. We aim to complete these assessments within five working days, but depending on the complexity of the application, some assessments may take longer. A cost estimate will be provided to you once the assessment is complete. You may then choose to accept, reject or query the estimate. Please note: If any details are missing from your application, we will contact you for more information so that we can accurately assess your case; this may delay processing your application. Incomplete applications may be rejected. In addition, if changes are made to your application during the determination process the MMO may be required to undertake further consultation, this would therefore result in additional costs and delays to the decision making process.

Fishing vessel licence requirements,https://www.gov.uk/guidance/do-i-need-a-fishing-vessel-licence,8 January 2025,"Fishing vessel licence requirements The licence sets out where you can fish, what you are not allowed to fish and the limits for the stocks you are allowed to fish and land. Introduction Fishing vessels registered in the UK and fishing within UK waters must have a domestic fishing vessel licence to fish for sea fish that will be sold. The purpose of the licensing system is to restrict the size of the UK fleet and control UK fishing opportunities to stay within quota limits. There are different types of licence, depending on the length of the vessel, the species fished and the waters the vessel will operate in. You need a domestic fishing vessel licence to fish in UK waters. For fishing opportunities outside of UK waters you should contact the UK Single Issuing Authority . This guide helps you to decide if you need a licence and the type of licence that you need. It also explains that you will have to register your vessel and obtain a licence entitlement before you can apply for a vessel licence. Do you need a fishing vessel licence? If your vessel is registered in the UK you must have a domestic fishing vessel licence to fish within the UK waters for sea fish that will be sold. The licence system ensures that the UK does not exceed its yearly quotas. If you fish for sea fish without a licence and sell your catch, you may be prosecuted. You may have to pay a fine of up to £50,000 for each offence and forfeit your gear and fish. No new licences are being issued so you will have to obtain a licence entitlement before you can apply for a licence. Vessels that don’t require a licence You don’t need a licence if: you only fish for salmon or migratory trout - contact the Environment Agency for more information your vessel is 10 metres or less in length and you’re only going to fish for common eels you only fish within the 12 nautical mile limits around Jersey, Guernsey or the Isle of Man - contact the relevant authority for advice about their licensing requirements you onl","Fishing vessel licence requirements Fishing vessel licence requirements The licence sets out where you can fish, what you are not allowed to fish and the limits for the stocks you are allowed to fish and land Introduction Fishing vessels registered in the UK and fishing within UK waters must have a domestic fishing vessel licence to fish for sea fish that will be sold You need a domestic fishing vessel licence to fish in UK waters For fishing opportunities outside of UK waters you should contact the UK Single Issuing Authority It also explains that you will have to register your vessel and obtain a licence entitlement before you can apply for a vessel licence Do you need a fishing vessel licence If your vessel is registered in the UK you must have a domestic fishing vessel licence to fish within the UK waters for sea fish that will be sold Vessels that don’t require a licence You don’t need a licence if: you only fish for salmon or migratory trout - contact the Environment Agency for more information your vessel is 10 metres or less in length and you’re only going to fish for common eels you only fish within the 12 nautical mile limits around Jersey, Guernsey or the Isle of Man - contact the relevant authority for advice about their licensing requirements you onl",Marine Licensing,0.30979195,0.11886214,Marine Licensing,OK

Eastern Atlantic bluefin tuna (BFT) (Thunnus thynnus) are present again in UK waters after an absence of many years. The International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) is the Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (RFMO) responsible for managing Atlantic BFT. As a contracting member of ICCAT and quota share holder, the UK is required to submit an annual fishing plan detailing how our BFT quota will be used each year. For 2024, our annual fishing plan has now been endorsed by ICCAT detailing how our 66.15 tonnes of quota will be used this year. This includes 16 tonnes to allow for UK recreational permitting schemes, and 39 tonnes for a UK trial commercial fishery. The remainder will be used to account for UK commercial bycatch and tagging programmes. The decisions on how government intend to use our quota have been made to ensure that BFT fisheries meet our international commitments, contribute to delivering Fisheries Act 2020 objectives, and reflect stakeholder interests including both the commercial and recreational fishers.

Applies to England Traditional moorings In UK waters, traditional swing moorings have been the most common mooring used. These moorings consist of an anchor (block), chain (rode) and a float. These parts can interact with and impact the seabed and benthic habitats. As the tide rises and falls, differing amounts of chain will lie and move across the seabed, being pulled around by the wind and tidal influences on the buoy or attached vessel. This can scour the seabed and damage sensitive marine habitats such as seagrass, maerl (a purple-pink hard seaweed) and reef. These habitats support a wide range of marine wildlife, serving as nurseries and feeding grounds for various protected and commercially important fish species. How traditional moorings work compared to advanced mooring systems (AMS). The benefits of Advanced Mooring Systems Advanced mooring systems (AMS) have been designed specifically to have minimal impact on the seabed and provide an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional moorings or anchoring. There are various AMS designs that exist, with changes often made to the rode (for example using a buoyant elastic component that does not lie along the seabed) or the anchor (for example a helical screw pile rather than a block). There is no ‘one size fits all’ AMS. The suitability of the chosen components vary depending on local factors including water depth, sediment depth, sediment type, tidal range, and wave energy. There is also evidence of reduced impacts to seabed habitats from switching to rope rather than chain risers. Please see advice on AMS application developed through Natural England’s ReMedies project here: Advanced Mooring Systems (AMS): LIFE Recreation ReMEDIES: Lessons learned and good practice Guidance on obtaining a marine lic","Moorings, consents and advice Moorings, consents and advice Marine Management Organisation guidance on the environmental benefits of advanced mooring systems over traditional moorings, as well as the consent and marine licencing process Applies to England Traditional moorings In UK waters, traditional swing moorings have been the most common mooring used These moorings consist of an anchor (block), chain (rode) and a float How traditional moorings work compared to advanced mooring systems (AMS) The benefits of Advanced Mooring Systems Advanced mooring systems (AMS) have been designed specifically to have minimal impact on the seabed and provide an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional moorings or anchoring There are various AMS designs that exist, with changes often made to the rode (for example using a buoyant elastic component that does not lie along the seabed) or the anchor (for example a helical screw pile rather than a block) There is also evidence of reduced impacts to seabed habitats from switching to rope rather than chain risers Please see advice on AMS application developed through Natural England’s ReMedies project here: Advanced Mooring Systems (AMS): LIFE Recreation ReMEDIES: Lessons learned and good practice Guidance on obtaining a marine lic",Marine Licensing,0.25845724,0.08154188,Unclassified,REVIEW_SCORE_BELOW_THRESHOLD

Important update - 25 September 2025 On 12 August, MMO published an article confirming that Succorfish (supplier of SC2 devices) was no longer forwarding I-VMS data to the UK VMS Hub, and that discussions were underway to resolve this matter. On 19 September, Devon & Severn IFCA (DSIFCA) announced plans to introduce ReWire devices to fishers in its district. MMO understands this is a temporary measure to address the ceasing of data transmissions by Succorfish SC2 I-VMS devices to the UK VMS Hub. The use of ReWire devices is specific to fishers currently affected by the suspended data transmission by Succorfish, within the DSIFCA district, to obtain positional information required under their bylaw and ensure fishers can be compliant. We are in discussion with DSIFCA about the technical elements of introducing these devices, including the use of the data. We are also aware that other IFCAs with byelaws or permit requirements may also be exploring temporary options. Fishers should contact their IFCA directly for further information. Meanwhile, MMO continues to work with Succorfish to resolve this matter and would like to thank fishers for their patience while we do so. All fishers should continue to operate as normal, including having their I-VMS devices switched on and transmitting positional data while at sea. Data transmissions by SC2 devices will still reach the supplier’s server. Our measured approach to enforcement of the licence condition remains in place at this time. We will issue another update when more information is available. If you have any questions, please contact the I-VMS Help Desk at ivms@marinemanagement.org.uk or 01900 508618.

Marine protected areas (MPAs) are areas of the ocean established to protect habitats, species and processes essential for healthy, functioning marine ecosystems. The purpose of an MPA is to protect and recover rare, threatened and important habitats and species from damage caused by human activities. In the UK all MPAs are designated to protect specific habitats or species, also known as features, and have conservation objectives set which state what conservation outcomes the MPA is designed to achieve. As part of the Environmental Improvement Plan Government has committed to ensuring that 48% of marine protected area (MPA) features are in favourable condition by 2028, and 70% by 2042, with the remaining in recovering condition. There are 178 MPAs in English waters, covering 51% of inshore and 37% of offshore waters. To view all English MPAs visit our Explore Marine Plans tool.

Marine Mammal Reporting Requirements,https://www.gov.uk/guidance/marine-mammal-reporting-requirements,30 January 2025,"Marine Mammal Reporting Requirements This page details the requirements for the Marine Mammal Reporting licence condition which has been in all fishing vessel licences since 2021. In 2021, the MMO placed a condition into all fishing vessel licences requiring vessels to report incidents where a vessel’s fishing activities have caused or contributed to marine mammal injury or death, or where marine mammals have been caught as bycatch, within 48 hours of the end of a fishing trip. As well as bycatch, this includes any interactions with marine mammals resulting in injury or death whilst searching for fish, shooting or setting gear, towing and hauling gear, taking catch on board, or from entanglement in ropes or lines. Reason for collection To continue to export fisheries products to the United States (US), and to assist conservation efforts in mitigating marine mammal bycatch, the UK needs to comply with international standards for the conservation of marine mammals. This licence condition was introduced to help gather the relevant information to help the UK demonstrate compliance with these standards. Use of information The information provided by fishers in compliance with this licence condition is reported by the MMO to the American National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The bycatch information may also be shared with DEFRA and wider MMO teams, working on initiatives to try and reduce marine mammal bycatch within fisheries. In line with the MMO’s statutory responsibilities in relation to fishing vessel licensing, data reported via this form will be shared with the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (‘DEFRA’) as well as the other UK Fishing Authorities of Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, and the Isle of Man.

Manage and lease fishing quota,https://www.gov.uk/guidance/manage-and-lease-fishing-quota,14 January 2020,"Manage and lease fishing quota How you can manage, allocate, swap, transfer or lease fishing quotas. How we manage fisheries quota The Secretary of State determines fishing opportunities for British fishing vessels via the setting of maximum limits that can be caught for some stocks, these are known as quota limits. Quota is divided between England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. All UK vessels are subject to detailed quota management rules, which are updated each year.
The Marine Management Organisation (MMO) is responsible for managing England’s fishing quotas and publishes specific English quota management rules for English vessels. MMO monitors landings of quota stocks and compares the amount caught and landed against total quota allocation. This is used to inform decisions about quota swaps, changes to catch limits and closing fisheries. Quota allocations MMO divides up England’s fishing quotas across the 3 fishing industry groups: sector – fish producer organisations that manage quota for their members 10-metres-and-under pool – vessels 10 metres or under that are not members of a producer organisation non-sector – vessels over 10 metres that are not members of a producer organisations The number of fixed quota allocation (FQA) units held by the individual vessels in each group, or by a group collectively, establishes what proportion of the quota is allocated to each group. The quota assigned to the non-sector and 10-metre-and-under pools may be adjusted in line with underpinning arrangements – this is where there are guaranteed minimum levels of allocated quota. The minimum level for each stock will be a percentage of the UK quota equal to the average percentage share of initial allocations made to the 10-metres-and-under fleet from 1991 to 1993. For vessels over 10 metres, FQA units are associated with the licence of the vessel. For vessels 10 metres and under, FQA units are held centrally by MMO.

Protection of common sturgeon: advice for fishermen,https://www.gov.uk/guidance/protection-of-common-sturgeon-advice-for-fishermen,16 January 2017,"Protection of common sturgeon: advice for fishermen Advice and guidance on the catch, landing and sale of common sturgeon. The Common or European Sturgeon (Acipenser sturio) are rarely seen in British waters, however a re-introduction programme in France has increased the potential for sightings and bycatch, with a number of catches recently reported in the English Channel. Common sturgeon is protected under the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2017, the Conservation of Offshore Marine Habitats and Species Regulations 2017 and the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. They are also classed as a ‘Royal Fish’ and any sturgeon caught are the right of the Crown. What to do if you catch a common sturgeon It is an offence to land sturgeon without specific permission to do so from the MMO. The MMO may issue a dispensation allowing you to land a dead sturgeon as long as it can be shown that it will be used for scientific research.  The scientific community can gain valuable information from these fish, and so an authorised landing maybe granted to a scientific institution such as the Natural History Museum or Cefas. To find out more about dispensations If a dead sturgeon is caught it should be returned to the sea if the skipper cannot get through to an MMO office immediately It is important that any live fish are immediately returned to the sea unharmed. Due to the critical state of common sturgeon population numbers, the survival of each fish is essential. If a live fish is caught it should be released and the following organisations should be contacted: Marine Management Organisation (MMO) local office Receiver of the Wreck (acting on behalf of the crown in relation to Royal fish) Any tagged fish are part of the current French re-introduction programme.

Overview The Marine Management Organisation (MMO) is generally responsible for taking decisions on marine licensing applications. In some circumstances it can refer an application to government ministers for a decision rather than making a licensing decision itself. When certain criteria apply, the MMO will refer an application to ministers so they can  decide whether to recover it. If ministers recover the application, they will set up a public inquiry. Ministers will then make the final decision on the application. These referrals from the MMO go to ministers responsible for the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). Criteria for recovery For ministers to recover a marine licensing application, it must meet all 3 of the following criteria: it falls in band 3 of MMO’s licence charging scheme, covering the larger and more complex projects it is for an activity taking place wholly or partly in English waters up to 6 nautical miles from the coast it could have a significant effect and raise issues appropriate for examination in an inquiry Request a referral Individuals or organisations can ask a Local Planning Authority (LPA) or Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authority (IFCA) to request that the MMO refers an application to ministers if they think it meets the 3 criteria.

How we respond to marine pollution incidents,https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-we-respond-to-marine-pollution-incidents,31 July 2018,"How we respond to marine pollution incidents How to report marine pollution incidents, the response to an incident and how to get approval to use an oil spill treatment product. Introduction Oil and other pollutants which are occasionally spilt into the sea can endanger environmental resources and property, as well as putting human life at risk. Where environmental resources, human health or property are at risk, a range of products and equipment are available to minimise the impact of the oil. As a global leader in responding to marine pollution, however, the UK has well-tested systems in place to deal with incidents. The turbulent nature of UK waters means it is rarely possible to recover the spilled oil. However, treatment products work with the wave action by mixing the product with the oil and encouraging it to disperse. Incidents Maritime Rescue Co-ordination Centres act as co-ordinators during incidents and circulate all pollution or situation reports to the Marine Management Organisation ( MMO ) for English waters. Marine Scotland, Natural Resources Wales and the Northern Ireland Environment Agency are responsible for their waters. Copies are also sent to national and regional statutory nature conservation agencies, and local councils that may be affected by the oil spill. In the event of a major spill, these organisations set-up an environment group to give advice on the suitable response to changing circumstances. MMO aims to approve or refuse oil spill treatment product use within 1 hour of being asked to authorise dispersant use. MMO can also give advice on the type of product most suitable for dealing with a particular incident. MMO aims to ensure that damage caused by the oil or oil spill treatment product is minimised.

You must have a fishing vessel licence issued by one of the UK or Crown dependency fisheries administrations to fish for profit for sea fish (including shellfish) from a UK vessel. It is an offence to fish for profit from a vessel without a licence. If you don’t have a fishing vessel licence you will need to charter a licensed fishing vessel. The Single issuing Authority issues licences for all commercial fishing vessels in UK waters. Any UK boat measuring 10 metres or under which does not have an engine to power the boat, does not need to have a licence and may sell their catch. Quota, effort and minimum landing sizes You will have to comply with quota, effort and minimum landing size regulations unless you have a relevant dispensation (exemption) . These rules apply even if the vessel is chartered by an organisation on whose behalf the species are collected. Scientific research MMO may issue a dispensation to a vessel from certain UK laws for scientific research. Collecting species for supply to aquariums for display purposes will not normally fulfill the criteria for this. MMO will only consider requests when evidence proves the dispensation is necessary and appropriate for scientific investigation.

I-VMS - Frequently asked questions,https://www.gov.uk/guidance/i-vms-frequently-asked-questions,12 May 2025,"I-VMS - Frequently asked questions 1. About I-VMS 1.1 Why is I-VMS being introduced? Vessel monitoring is a tool that will enable a better understanding of scale, location, and seasonality of fishing activity. This additional information combined with other fisheries data will grow our understanding of fishing and will assist in quota negotiations and marine spatial planning as well as allowing us to identify and respond more swiftly to new issues. Data about the location, scale, and seasonality of fishing effort from the majority of English fishers will also provide industry and regulators with more powerful information they can use when presenting their case for example in planning consents for marine development, fisheries management, or resolution of gear conflict issues with other marine users. Coupled with the outputs from our fisheries assurance service MMO will also be able to better target our risk-based, intelligence-led assurance and inspections activities. In time, it may enable steps towards a lighter touch for fishers who demonstrate a consistently high level of compliance. It will enable more precise delineation between fishing grounds and protected areas meaning a better balance between keeping fishing grounds open and protecting sensitive marine habitats and species can be established. It will enable improved control of non-English vessels in English waters as the current requirement is for all under-12m vessels to carry a vessel monitoring device. Vessel monitoring could increase safety for smaller vessel operators as it could provide timely and accurate detail to inform search and rescue efforts if necessary. 1.2 Which vessels does I-VMS apply to? I-VMS is  a requirement for any licenced English under-12m vessel undertaking a trip to sea from 12 May 2025. This is part of a new licence condition introduced to support English fishers be prepared ahead of statutory legislation, expected to be laid by government later this year.

Apply to generate energy offshore,https://www.gov.uk/guidance/offshore-energy-generation-consents,11 June 2014,"Apply to generate energy offshore Offshore generating stations may require a marine licence and other consent. Offshore generating stations with a capacity of more than 100 megawatts ( MW ) and onshore generating stations with a capacity of more than 50MW are classed as nationally significant infrastructure projects ( NSIP ). These require an order from the relevant Secretary of State and this may deem a marine licence to have been granted. There are other consents you may need for an offshore energy installation. Electricity Act 1989 consents You will need consent from MMO to construct, extend or operate any offshore generating stations with a generating capacity of between 1 and 100MW – section 36. You must apply for consent to remove the public rights of navigation that pass through the generating station – section 36A. Application fees vary depending on the generating capacity of the installation. If you need both consents you must apply for both at the same time. Further guidance on Section 36 variations . Some electricity generating works may be subject to regulation under the Electricity Works (Environmental Impact Assessment) (England and Wales) Regulations 2000 (as amended) and require an environmental impact assessment EIA to be submitted to the MMO alongside the main application. Safety zone applications You can apply to MMO for a safety zone declaration to apply around offshore renewable energy generating stations. Safety zone applications can be made at same time as the section 36 consent or independently. You should declare whether you intend to apply for a safety zone declaration when you apply for section 36 consent. Safety zone declarations can have different phases to cover construction, operation and decommissioning, but they do not cover cables (either inter-array or export).

Important update – 12 May 2025 A licence condition is now in force, requiring the use of an MMO type-approved I-VMS device on any English under-12m vessel undertaking any trip to sea. An I-VMS device is a tool that captures the position, course and speed of the vessel. This data will provide valuable insights to the activities of the inshore fleet, and when combined with other data, such as that collected for the over-12m fleet, we will have a more complete picture of all fishing in English waters. This will be used to support decisions and assessments, such as, but not limited to, fisheries management planning, policy development, conservation efforts, statistical and scientific analysis, compliance and law enforcement. See below for details on MMO type-approved devices and information on the steps to take to purchase and install a device. For more details about I-VMS please visit our guidance pages . Type-approved devices The following tracking devices have passed the MMO I-VMS type-approval process by meeting the I-VMS device specification of requirements. All products have undergone evaluation under the I-VMS approval process and are expected to last for at least five years provided they are handled appropriately. All of these products have been designed to be suitable for vessels with or without on-board power.

These compulsory changes include: The marking of passive gears for all vessels. Changes in the requirements for completing an electronic logbook for vessels of 12 metres overall length or more. Changes to the frequency of VMS reports when fishing in and around restricted areas. Defra, Marine Management Organisation (MMO) and UK fishing administrations acknowledge this late notification will be an additional burden on industry and have pledged to support impacted fishing vessels. The EU and its member states have been contacted to ask what their intended enforcement approach will be from January 10. UK Government is still awaiting the response which ultimately rests with each member state within its own waters. Sean Douglas, Head of Regulatory Assurance, MMO, said: We recognise there is already enormous change going on for industry as a result of EU changes and we accept the late notice of this further need will not be helpful as industry will need time to comply fully with the legislation. We want to support industry with the changes and have already approached the EU and members states encouraging them to take a pragmatic approach to enforcement.  We must accept though it is for individual member to decide what the decision will be for any vessels entering to fish in their waters. We are in the process of updating our guidance on this and will update industry when available.

Cuttlefish Fishery Action Plan,https://www.gov.uk/guidance/cuttlefish-fishery-action-plan,10 April 2025,"Cuttlefish Fishery Action Plan Marine Management Organisation (MMO) has implemented actions under the Fisheries Management Plans (FMP) for sustainable fisheries, social and economic goals in English waters of International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) divisions 7d and 7e. Background The Channel Demersal Non-Quota Species (NQS) FMP published in December 2023, highlighted the cuttlefish fishery as a data poor species and has no formal ICES stock assessment. The FMP further identified the fishery as being of high economic importance and a critical targeted fishery at risk of over exploitation. MMO has been tasked by the Defra to develop an action plan for the cuttlefish fishery, a specific short-term measure from the Channel Demersal NQS FMP, which covers English waters ICES divisions 7d and 7e. Action Plan MMO’s review of stakeholder responses and analysis of landings data concluded that there is no clear indication that the fishery is being exploited beyond sustainable limit and MMO are not looking to introduce any formal management at this time. The long-term aim of the action plan is to deliver sustainable exploitation of the cuttlefish fishery, however in the first iteration of the action plan aims to introduce greater monitoring and data collection to help inform future management. MMO has developed a series of actions under the FMPs sustainable fisheries, social and economic and evidence goals for the cuttlefish fishery in English waters of ICES divisions 7d and 7e. The rationale for the action plan is to consider the measures proposed for cuttlefish in the FMP.  Increase and improve quality of data monitoring and fill evidence and data gaps. Improve egg survivability and protect juveniles to support future cuttlefish repopulation and collaborate with key stakeholders to develop and improve the future iterations of the action plan. This action plan has been drafted following FMP recommendations and engagement with key stakeholders.

In 2021, the UK will become solely responsible for our seas, and will begin new trading relationships with the EU and the rest of the world. Exports of fish, seafood, or seafood products to EU countries will need digital UK catch certificates to provide traceability data.  Paper logbook records enable these catch certificates to be issued. It is therefore even more important that paper logbook are submitted on time and that all logbooks, landing declarations, catch records and sales notes have accurate data.  To facilitate sales and exports, the paper logbook, landing declarations and sales notes for all consignments should have corresponding landing dates to avoid any possible delays or blockages to the process.

Generating energy offshore,https://www.gov.uk/guidance/generating-energy-offshore,18 September 2014,"Generating energy offshore Information about generating energy offshore Offshore generating stations in English waters such as wind farms and wave and tidal devices will require consent before they can be built and before they can generate energy. Stations which would generate more than 100 megawatts ( MW ) are classed as nationally significant infrastructure projects and require a development consent order granted by the Secretary of State. This may supersede the need for the other consents outlined below. Marine licences The construction of works, deposit of substances or articles, dredging and many other activities require a marine licence from Marine Management Organisation ( MMO ). Often offshore generating stations will include licensable activities. You can find more information about how to apply , the activities which require a licence and apply for a licence online. Electricity Act 1989 consents You will need consent from MMO to construct, extend or operate any offshore generating stations with a generating capacity of between 1 and 100MW – section 36 You can also apply to remove the public rights of navigation that pass through the generating station, a section 36A declaration. If applying for a section 36A declaration this must be done at the same time as your application for section 36 consent.

Important update - 25 September 2025 On 12 August, MMO published an article confirming that Succorfish (supplier of SC2 devices) was no longer forwarding I-VMS data to the UK VMS Hub, and that discussions were underway to resolve this matter. On 19 September, Devon & Severn IFCA (DSIFCA) announced plans to introduce ReWire devices to fishers in its district. MMO understands this is a temporary measure to address the ceasing of data transmissions by Succorfish SC2 I-VMS devices to the UK VMS Hub. The use of ReWire devices is specific to fishers currently affected by the suspended data transmission by Succorfish, within the DSIFCA district, to obtain positional information required under their bylaw and ensure fishers can be compliant. We are in discussion with DSIFCA about the technical elements of introducing these devices, including the use of the data. We are also aware that other IFCAs with byelaws or permit requirements may also be exploring temporary options. Fishers should contact their IFCA directly for further information. Meanwhile, MMO continues to work with Succorfish to resolve this matter and would like to thank fishers for their patience while we do so. All fishers should continue to operate as normal, including having their I-VMS devices switched on and transmitting positional data while at sea. Data transmissions by SC2 devices will still reach the supplier’s server. Our measured approach to enforcement of the licence condition remains in place at this time. We will issue another update when more information is available. If you have any questions, please contact the I-VMS Help Desk at ivms@marinemanagement.org.uk or 01900 508618.

This guidance was archived on 22 August 2023. The application process closed on 1 October 2021. For a current list of MMO type-approved I-VMS devices, please see the list of I-VMS type-approved devices for under-12 metre English vessels . A programme to assess vessel monitoring systems has been conducted and four devices have been type approved in 2021, having met technical specifications, for the reporting of location, heading and speed by under 12 metre fishing vessels. The following information outlines the process followed. If you are interested in being updated in the event of any future I-VMS approval programme please email IVMS@management.org.uk to be added to a mailing list. Vessels under 12m long will be legally required to report positional data from an approved device to the MMO operations room during fishing trips. This data will enable a better understanding of the scale, location and seasonality of fishing activity. To support fishers in obtaining an I-VMS device that meets this forthcoming legal requirement and is suitable for their vessel, the MMO’s ‘type approval’ process is intended to bring as many suppliers into the marketplace as possible so that there’s a broad choice of devices at a range of prices for fishers to choose from.
In the under-12m fishing fleet, the range of specifications for vessels - for example, in terms of powering and housing the devices – is diverse. Vessel owners are best placed, with the right support from suppliers, to decide which device and service package suits them.

Quota management in the non-sector <10m and >10m pools,https://www.gov.uk/guidance/quota-management-in-the-non-sector-10m-and-10m-pools,10 March 2021,"Quota management in the non-sector <10m and >10m pools Vessels that do not have their quota managed by a Producer Organisation are managed by the Marine Management Organisation via catch limits. Vessels that do not have their quota managed by a Producer Organisation are managed by the MMO via catch limits. Catch limits are set predominantly monthly but are also set weekly or quarterly for some stocks. Vessels are categorised by length; either over or under-10m and all vessels within each length category are bound by the same catch limits. If a vessel wishes to join the Over-10m Non-sector pool the MMO reserves the right to require that vessel’s licence to bring with it FQA units appropriate to the planned fishing area and gear or equivalent to the English non-sector catch limits in the previous full quota year as per the English quota management rules. How catch limits are set. The goal of quota management is to provide sufficient quota throughout the year to suit the needs of all fishers in a sustainable manner. Typically this also means aiming to facilitate maximum profit from available quota with the aim of reaching 95 – 100% uptake by year end.
To achieve this catch limits are set by the MMO in conjunction with advice from industry and they may be set such that uptake is equal throughout the year or they can be set to reflect seasonality of stock abundance or fluctuations in market price. As the year progresses catch limits may be increased or decreased proportional to the amount of quota already used and the potential for acquiring additional quota via trading.
The MMO uses quota uptake information and uptake modelling to help decide catch limits but importantly the MMO consults with industry in the following ways: A monthly catch limit consultation is posted on the government and MMO webpages: Industry meetings are held around the coast in the form of Quota Advisory Groups (QAGs) and in partnership with existing industry organisations South West QAG South Coas",Quota management in the non-sector <10m and >10m pools Quota management in the non-sector <10m and >10m pools Vessels that do not have their quota managed by a Producer Organisation are managed by the Marine Management Organisation via catch limits Vessels that do not have their quota managed by a Producer Organisation are managed by the MMO via catch limits Vessels are categorised by length; either over or under-10m and all vessels within each length category are bound by the same catch limits If a vessel wishes to join the Over-10m Non-sector pool the MMO reserves the right to require that vessel’s licence to bring with it FQA units appropriate to the planned fishing area and gear or equivalent to the English non-sector catch limits in the previous full quota year as per the English quota management rules The goal of quota management is to provide sufficient quota throughout the year to suit the needs of all fishers in a sustainable manner To achieve this catch limits are set by the MMO in conjunction with advice from industry and they may be set such that uptake is equal throughout the year or they can be set to reflect seasonality of stock abundance or fluctuations in market price As the year progresses catch limits may be increased or decreased proportional to the amount of quota already used and the potential for acquiring additional quota via trading The MMO uses quota uptake information and uptake modelling to help decide catch limits but importantly the MMO consults,Marine Planning,0.11154042,0.018702812,Unclassified,REVIEW_LOW_SCORE
Regional Fisheries Groups - South East 4c,https://www.gov.uk/guidance/regional-fisheries-groups-south-east-4c,27 November 2023,"Regional Fisheries Groups - South East 4c The region covers Mablethorpe to Hythe. Back to RFG homepage Date of next meeting: Date of next meeting is to be confirmed. Please contact regionalfisheriesgroups@marinemanagement.org.uk in the meantime. Successes in the South East 4c: 1. Grants FaSS match rates on Health & Safety funding The NW RFG raised the disparity between the amount for grant funding available for bottom towed gear and other gear types. The Defra FaSS team bought a paper to the board asking for the match-funding rates of fishing vessels which are classed as micro entities to be raised to 80% for Health & Safety projects regardless of the type of fishing gear used. This would bring them in line with the rate available to small-scale coastal fishers (SSCF). Following discussions within this group and with the HM Treasury, the change has been approved: match-funding rates for any vessel with a length of 12m or less will be raised to 80% for Health & Safety projects, regardless of the type of gear used. 2. Additional Quota 2021 round Additional Quota was made available from the MMO at the end of 2021. The one-time offer meant a small amount of the additional quota England received from the Trade and Cooperation Agreement was distributed via selected Producer Organisations (PO) without cost to the U10m vessel or benefit to the PO. It enabled capped vessels to fish above their annual 350kg limit for quota stocks before January 1 2022. 3. Additional Quota 2022 round A similar scheme took place again in 2022 starting earlier in the year. Temporary lift of the under-10m licence cap from 1 August 2022.

Since 2015 the UK quotas have been set for two ICES areas at bycatch levels of 26 tonnes in area VIIe and 2 tonnes in area VIId. The MMO carried out a consultation in 2015 to provide an opportunity to inform how the quotas are managed. Five responses were received and the content of these has been considered in deciding to keep the fishery at a bycatch level of 20kgs per vessel per trip. This is the maximum permitted by the European regulation. In the UK the following applies: Retention of no more than 20kg live weight per trip caught in ICES area VIIe only. Catches to be reported separately under code RJU. Provision of detailed geo-referenced catch and effort data, i.e. catch parameters (landings and discards) and gear characteristics (soak time or tow duration as appropriate) A joint statement between the UK and other EU member states places the following conditions on the landing of undulate rays: Minimum landing length of 78 cm, maximum landing length of 97 cm. Three-month ban on landing undulate ray during their breeding season. Development of a code of good practice in cooperation with stakeholders. No transhipment at sea of specimens.

An interactive tool – Explore Marine Plans – explains how marine plans apply to different marine sectors and geographic areas. It highlights policies that apply to a chosen area to inform plan users, and mapping information makes searching for your area of interest easier. 1. Select plan area The Marine Management Organisation ( MMO ) decided to plan an inshore and offshore area together and to select an area that did not share borders administered by Marine Scotland or the Welsh Government. MMO judged that the East marine areas would offer the best opportunity for planning to make a significant positive impact at that current time. MMO considered: potential benefits to the region of the planning process increasing pressure on marine users and the natural environment because of planned wind farm development a wide range of activities good potential for future sustainable development a significant contribution to the national economy the wide range of communities any benefits that planning could bring to less well-off communities Read the ‘Decision on first marine plan areas’ .

It stretches from mean high water springs to 12 nautical miles offshore off the coastline between Flamborough Head and Felixstowe. The East Offshore Marine Plan area extends from the outer boundary of the East Inshore area to England’s borders with the Netherlands, Belgium and France.

This comprehensive review examined key aspects of the fishing industry, including supply chains, fishing opportunities, transport infrastructure, market access, and consumer engagement. The resulting report outlined 12 strategic recommendations aimed at strengthening regional connections to establish a more consistent and efficient supply chain. These recommendations have been incorporated into the Northwest Action Plan. To drive this initiative forward, a steering group was formed, bringing together representatives from across the supply chain to identify and prioritize key actions within the plan. Seafish supported these efforts by gathering economic data to inform discussions and highlight shared industry priorities. The initiative has focused on two core areas: promoting the Northwest fishing industry and enhancing transport and logistics.

Grants FaSS match rates on Health & Safety funding The NW RFG raised the disparity between the amount for grant funding available for bottom towed gear and other gear types. The Defra FaSS team bought a paper to the board asking for the match-funding rates of fishing vessels which are classed as micro entities to be raised to 80% for Health & Safety projects regardless of the type of fishing gear used. This would bring them in line with the rate available to small-scale coastal fishers (SSCF). Following discussions within this group and with the HM Treasury, the change has been approved: match-funding rates for any vessel with a length of 12m or less will be raised to 80% for Health & Safety projects, regardless of the type of gear used. 2. Additional Quota 2021 round Additional Quota was made available from the MMO at the end of 2021. The one-time offer meant a small amount of the additional quota England received from the Trade and Cooperation Agreement was distributed via selected Producer Organisations (PO) without cost to the U10m vessel or benefit to the PO. It enabled capped vessels to fish above their annual 350kg limit for quota stocks before January 1 2022. 3. Additional Quota 2022 round A similar scheme took place again in 2022 starting earlier in the year. Temporary lift of the under-10m licence cap from 1 August 2022. The cap on some under-10m vessels which restricts their uptake to no more than 350kg per year of quota stocks was temporarily lifted for the remainder of 2022.

Operational Programme Articles 17 to 20 of the EMFF Regulation (EU) 508/2014 require participating states to produce an ‘operational programme’ for the EMFF. The operational programme sets out how states intend to spend their EMFF budget and is subject to approval by the European Commission (EC) and the UK Programme Monitoring Committee (PMC). The Programme Monitoring Committee is composed of representatives from Industry and EMFF Authorities; members are responsible to review the implementation of the Operational Programme and the UK progress toward achieving its objectives. The original operational programme was approved by PMC and submitted to the European Commission on 30th October 2015 and adopted by the Commission on the 30th November 2015, enabling the launch of the EMFF in the UK by the Minister on 8th February 2016. Since launching, the UK have submitted two requests to the PMC and the EC to modify the operational programme, both requests were approved in 2020. The first amendment was triggered by the need to reallocate the EMFF performance reserve (€0.3 million) for Integrated Maritime Policy. This amendment provided further opportunity for devolved administrations to review their core budgets and set out options for budget moves to meet their respective industry demands. The 2023 targets pertinent to the UK scheme were modified based on actual scheme performance, many targets were stretched to better reflect the value of the UK’s €243million investment. This amendment was approved by PMC on the 12th December 2019 and adopted by the Commission on the 26th March 2020. The second amendment was made in response to the Commission’s implementation of Regulation (EU) 2020/560 which provided measures to mitigate the impact of the Coronavirus pandemic on the fishery and aquaculture sector","European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF): UK Managing Authority (UKMA) European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF): UK Managing Authority (UKMA) Learn about how the UK Managing Authority (UKMA) manage the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) Operational Programme Articles 17 to 20 of the EMFF Regulation (EU) 508/2014 require participating states to produce an ‘operational programme’ for the EMFF The operational programme sets out how states intend to spend their EMFF budget and is subject to approval by the European Commission (EC) and the UK Programme Monitoring Committee (PMC) The Programme Monitoring Committee is composed of representatives from Industry and EMFF Authorities; members are responsible to review the implementation of the Operational Programme and the UK progress toward achieving its objectives The original operational programme was approved by PMC and submitted to the European Commission on 30th October 2015 and adopted by the Commission on the 30th November 2015, enabling the launch of the EMFF in the UK by the Minister on 8th February 2016 Since launching, the UK have submitted two requests to the PMC and the EC to modify the operational programme, both requests were approved in 2020 This amendment was approved by PMC on the 12th December 2019 and adopted by the Commission on the 26th March 2020 The second amendment was made in response to the Commission’s implementation of Regulation (EU) 2020/560 which provided measures to mitigate the impact",OMT,0.15735236,0.065128095,Unclassified,REVIEW_LOW_SCORE

The Domestic Seafood Supply Scheme (DSSS) is now closed for applications. Domestic Seafood Supply Scheme (DSSS) The Domestic Seafood Supply Scheme (DSSS), administered by the Marine Management Organisation (MMO), has been set up to help seafood businesses in England to increase the supply of local seafood to domestic markets. The government’s new DSSS will provide grant funding to projects that help to increase the supply of local seafood to domestic markets and help to increase consumption of locally caught seafood in the UK (whether live, fresh, landed and/or processed in England). The £1 million grants scheme will help to support the fishing and fish processing sectors adversely affected by the downturn in export markets due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Applications are invited for projects that support the industry to adapt to domestic sales and be equipped for local and regional distribution, for example with plant and equipment to help with local seafood processing, or assets that can be shared at port such as storage and refrigerated vans. In the longer term, the fund interventions will assist local economies of coastal communities, to help increase domestic consumption of seafood, improve food security and help ensure the UK population has ready access to a healthy and nutritious food source. The Domestic Seafood Supply Scheme is funded by HM Treasury and the Maritime and Fisheries Fund (MFF). It is administered by the Marine Management Organisation (MMO) and is a joint endeavour between Defra, MMO, Seafish and the fishing industry. Local seafood is defined as seafood landed in England and/or processed in England.

Guidance on England’s Demersal Reserve Quota allocation for 2020,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-englands-demersal-reserve-quota-allocation-for-2020,12 May 2020,"Guidance on England’s Demersal Reserve Quota allocation for 2020 Documents Table 1: 2020 English reserve quota approach Details To reflect the fact that all quota species are now subject to the Landing Obligation and will no longer be discarded, quota now includes landed and previously discarded catches so overall quota allocations to Member States continues to be increased to reflect this position.  With the exception where exemptions set out in the discard plans allow discarding to continue. Please see the MMO guidance for further details. This year, as in 2019, the European Commission has not provided separate figures on the portion of the TAC (Total Allowable Catch) for each stock which relates to this increase. Defra have therefore calculated an equivalent portion of the English share of the UK TAC, based on 2018 discard rates, where available. The calculations and discard percentages used can be found in the English allocations spreadsheet in the MMO fisheries quota allocation 2020 guidance. This quota is referred to as “reserve quota” by Defra and the MMO. This reserve quota policy applies to 2020 only. We will continue to review our approach to reserve quota taking into account any future changes to our discard policy and quota management after the end of the transition period. Allocation of reserve quota in 2020 Defra consulted industry in early 2020 on the allocation of reserve quota and has also conducted its own review of the reserve quota policy. Defra’s approach to allocating reserve quota in England in 2020 is intended to continue to support the non-sector while ensuring that reserve quota is allocated to parts of the fleet that will use it. Reserve quota will also be used to incentivise more sustainable fishing. In order to  support the non-sector, reserve quota for many stocks will continue to be top sliced and allocated to them, with any remaining quota either being allocated to the sector via FQA units or to vessels participating in the North Sea ","Guidance on England’s Demersal Reserve Quota allocation for 2020 Guidance on England’s Demersal Reserve Quota allocation for 2020 Documents Table 1: 2020 English reserve quota approach Details To reflect the fact that all quota species are now subject to the Landing Obligation and will no longer be discarded, quota now includes landed and previously discarded catches so overall quota allocations to Member States continues to be increased to reflect this position The calculations and discard percentages used can be found in the English allocations spreadsheet in the MMO fisheries quota allocation 2020 guidance This quota is referred to as “reserve quota” by Defra and the MMO This reserve quota policy applies to 2020 only We will continue to review our approach to reserve quota taking into account any future changes to our discard policy and quota management after the end of the transition period Allocation of reserve quota in 2020 Defra consulted industry in early 2020 on the allocation of reserve quota and has also conducted its own review of the reserve quota policy Defra’s approach to allocating reserve quota in England in 2020 is intended to continue to support the non-sector while ensuring that reserve quota is allocated to parts of the fleet that will use it Reserve quota will also be used to incentivise more sustainable fishing",FDST,0.12129335,0.003316775,Unclassified,REVIEW_LOW_SCORE

August 2025 - Quota Leasing Scheme Offer of underutilised quota to vessels in the non-sector with over 10 metre: Category B, C and no-quota annex licences. The MMO is opening a window for vessels in the non-sector with over 10 metre: Category B, C and no-quota annex licences to apply for access to underutilised quota. Vessels with these licences have a limited number of quota stocks for which they can fish. Under this scheme, these vessels can apply for access to more opportunities for the remainder of 2025. At this stage, only stocks where the MMO are confident there is excess within the non-sector pools will be released. The offer means that a small amount of the quota that England receives from the Trade and Cooperation Agreement will be distributed via the MMO to these vessels upon application and depending on availability. It will enable vessels with restricted non-sector licences to fish above their current limits for the leased quota stocks up to and including 31 December 2025. The latest window closed on the 2nd of September 2025. Please contact inshorequotamanager@marinemanagement.org,uk for further information Applications must be completed using the form located below.

Documents Marine pioneer projects Details Aspects of the coastal and marine environment are in decline (Charting Progress II) and we are causing irreversible damage to biodiversity and a loss of natural capital. This is despite previous efforts to prevent degradation and maintain and restore species and habitats. Current policies direct public and private organisations to manage the marine area as one whole system for example by using an ecosystem approach and sustainable development. Different initiatives are working on implementing these approaches e.g. marine planning, plan led licensing, sustainable fisheries and the UK Marine Strategy, but the marine environment is a complex interconnected system which we are still trying to fully understand. We are reliant on it for our health and prosperity. We must progress to not only preventing degradation but improving environmental health for current and future generations through collective societal, economic and environmental decisions. To tackle this and other similar issues the government has outlined a 25 year environment plan. The vision of the plan is that the environment will be in a better state for the next generation than it was for this generation. The plan has a longer term approach and a more holistic view. It aims to make sustainable use and restoration of the environment central to all society’s decisions. The pioneer has been set up to inform delivery of the 25 year environment plan. In particular to test the application of a natural capital approach, how to integrate planning and delivery further, how to apply better funding mechanisms and to share lessons.

These schemes have demonstrated the effectiveness of Remote Electronic Monitoring (REM) in reducing discards and encouraging more selective fishing behaviour. The behaviour of vessels fitted with REM has also been compared to vessels fishing in the same areas, using the same gear types, and has shown differences in both catch composition and grading. In addition, REM has proven to be a useful tool for gathering scientific data.  The MMO has collaborated with the Centre for the Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Sciences (Cefas) on exploring this use. Application forms and guidance are available. This scheme has been run since 2011.  Results of the scheme are published online. Vessels which wish to apply, must do so by Monday 22nd June 2020.  To apply, the vessel must be English-registered, and preferably a member of a Producer Organisation (PO), however, applications will also be considered from vessels in the non-sector. Where a vessel is new to the scheme, they will have to arrange for a suitable MMO approved REM  system to fitted at their own expense. In return for participation in this scheme, vessels will be able to access additional quota for North Sea stocks, however the species and quotas available have not been finalised.  In addition, scientific quota may be available. The scheme will run from July 1st until 31st December 2020.

In order to make the best use of this quota and to ensure opportunities are available to as many vessels as possible the MMO are taking the following action for English vessels. Offer of additional quota to vessels in the non-sector with Category B, C and no-quota annex licences. The MMO is opening a window for vessels in the non-sector with Category B, C and no-quota annex licences to apply for access to additional quota.

Under this scheme, these vessels can apply for access to more opportunities for the remainder of 2024. Only stocks where the MMO are confident there is excess within the non-sector pool will be released. The offer means that a small amount of the quota that England receives from the Trade and Cooperation Agreement will be distributed via the MMO to these vessels upon application and depending on availability. It will enable vessels with non-sector Category B, C or no-quota annex licences to fish above their current limits for the leased quota stocks up to and including 31 December 2024.

marine features such as seagrass, home to seahorses, shellfish and mammals. It’s especially harmful in England’s designated Marine Protected Areas. While there is as yet no regulation
preventing ships from anchoring in Marine Protected Areas, we are asking cruise operators to help protect our seas
by finding an alternative anchoring or mooring location. We know that the cruise sector prides itself on its environmental stewardship and people who take cruises expect a
very high standard so the MMO would like to work with the sector to identify Marine Protected Areas and help to
